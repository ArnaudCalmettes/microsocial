# Microsocial

This is a toy social network-like REST API written in Golang, using Buffalo.

It is currently a Work In Progress.

# Step-by-step demo

The modelization is completely finished. I'm using this step-by-step demo as a guide
to develop the API.

## Setting up the stage

The app is currently usable in "development mode" (the Docker release will come soon).
To set it up, update "database.yml" to point to a valid PostgreSQL database with the right
credentials.

Let's start by defining a bunch of users, using POST requests on the `/users` endpoint:

```bash
$ URL="localhost:3000"
$ curl -d '{"login": "JudgeDredd", "admin": true, "info": "Pacificator Maximus"}' http://$URL/users/
$ curl -d '{"login": "Alice", "info": "Live from Wonderland"}' http://$URL/users/
$ curl -d '{"login": "Bob"}' http://$URL/users/
```

Edge cases:

* If a user login is already taken, you get a 409 error.

So we've defined an admin and two regular users. Let's list them:

```bash
$ curl http://$URL/users/ | python3 -m json.tool
[
    {
        "id": "9b9f01f4-34e7-4cc3-8837-b1ade476f72e",
        "created_at": "2019-09-19T18:42:53.971323Z",
        "updated_at": "2019-09-19T18:42:53.97133Z",
        "login": "JudgeDredd",
        "info": "Pacificator Maximus",
        "admin": true
    },
    {
        "id": "2acc6f8a-42ec-4f4b-bfe8-149ed0a83372",
        "created_at": "2019-09-19T18:43:52.715929Z",
        "updated_at": "2019-09-19T18:43:52.715934Z",
        "login": "Alice",
        "info": "Live from Wonderland",
        "admin": false
    },
    {
        "id": "d9e24321-cd55-4349-85f8-047bec35175c",
        "created_at": "2019-09-19T18:44:13.407875Z",
        "updated_at": "2019-09-19T18:44:13.407881Z",
        "login": "Bob",
        "info": "",
        "admin": false
    }
]
```

Notes:

* All list-like calls (such as this one) support pagination: they accept
`page` and `per_page` GET parameters, and return pagination detail in an
`X-Pagination` header.

... Aaaaand that's pretty much all we can do without authentication.

Let's save the IDs in env variables for later:

```bash
$ ADMIN_ID=9b9f01f4-34e7-4cc3-8837-b1ade476f72e
$ ALICE_ID=2acc6f8a-42ec-4f4b-bfe8-149ed0a83372
$ BOB_ID=d9e24321-cd55-4349-85f8-047bec35175c
```

## Authentication

Authentication is basically out of the scope for this API, but there is a need
for some role management in the rest of it, so I wrote a simple
"fake" auth system based on JWT tokens.

If you place a GET request on the `/fake_auth/{login}` endpoint, you get a
token that you can pass as a `Authentication: Bearer <TOKEN>` header.

Let's define a couple env vars for the rest of this demo:

```bash
$ ADMIN_TOKEN=`curl http://$URL/fake_auth/JudgeDredd | sed 's/\"//g'`
$ ALICE_TOKEN=`curl http://$URL/fake_auth/Alice | sed 's/\"//g'`
$ BOB_TOKEN=`curl http://$URL/fake_auth/Bob | sed 's/\"//g'`
$ AS_ADMIN="Authorization: Bearer $ADMIN_TOKEN"
$ AS_ALICE="Authorization: Bearer $ALICE_TOKEN"
$ AS_BOB="Authorization: Bearer $BOB_TOKEN"
```

Now, we can use `curl -H $AS_ALICE ...` to interact with the API on behalf of Alice, and so
on.

Note: the default duration of the tokens is 24 hours. You can change this by using an `exp` GET
parameter when generating it. For instance:

* `?exp=10s` will generate a token that will expire in 10 seconds,
* `?exp=15m` for 15 minutes,
* `?exp=3h` for 3 hours.

## Basic user CRUD operations

The `/users` endpoint supports the classic CRUD operations:

* `GET /users` lists existing users (authentication not needed),
* `POST /users` creates a new user (authentication not needed),
* `GET /users/{user_id}` shows detailed user information, we'll see that later,
* `PUT /users/{user_id}` modifies an existing user,
* `DELETE /users/{user_id}` deletes a user,

We won't show everything here. Let's demo this by trying to change Bob's profile information.

```bash
$ curl -X PUT -d '{"info": "Not a sponge"}' "http://$URL/users/$BOB_ID"
{"error":"token not found in request","status":401}
```

Authentication is required. Let's try using Alice's token:

```bash
$ curl -X PUT -H $AS_ALICE -d '{"info": "Not a sponge"}' "http://$URL/users/$BOB_ID"
{"error":"Forbidden","status":403}
```

Of course, Alice can't modify Bob's information. Let's retry as Bob:

```bash
curl -X PUT -H $AS_BOB -d '{"info": "Not a sponge"}' "http://$URL/users/$BOB_ID"
{
    "id": "d9e24321-cd55-4349-85f8-047bec35175c",
    "created_at": "2019-09-19T18:44:13.407875Z",
    "updated_at": "2019-09-19T20:32:36.739483+02:00",
    "login": "Bob",
    "info": "Not a sponge",
    "admin": false
}
```

Success. This call can be used to modify:

* login (provided that the new login isn't already taken)
* info
* admin rights (although promotion requires admin credentials)

For instance, Bob can't escalate his own privileges:

```bash
curl -X PUT -H $AS_BOB -d '{"admin": true}' "http://$URL/users/$BOB_ID"
{"error":"I see what you did there!","status":403}
```

## Friends and friend requests

We'll simply quickly cover the nominal case here. A deeper and more thorough functional
test was written in `actions/friendships_test.go`.

Let's suppose Bob wants to become friends with Alice. He can place a friend request
by sending a POST to `/users/{user_id}/friend_request`.

```bash
$ curl -H $AS_BOB -d '{"message": "Please be my friend."}' \
    http://$URL/users/$ALICE_ID/friend_request
```

The request is visible as a "pending" request for Bob when he consults his profile,
and as an "incoming" request for Alice on her own profile:

```bash
$ curl -H $AS_BOB http://$URL/users/$BOB_ID |python3 -m json.tool
{
    "id": "d9e24321-cd55-4349-85f8-047bec35175c",
    "created_at": "2019-09-19T18:44:13.407875Z",
    "updated_at": "2019-09-19T20:32:36.739483Z",
    "login": "Bob",
    "info": "Not a sponge",
    "admin": false,
    "pending_requests": [
        {
            "id": "0f121386-f0cf-4f55-bb33-66a072d18801",
            "created_at": "2019-09-19T21:47:33.15393Z",
            "updated_at": "2019-09-19T21:47:33.153936Z",
            "to": {
                "id": "2acc6f8a-42ec-4f4b-bfe8-149ed0a83372",
                "created_at": "2019-09-19T18:43:52.715929Z",
                "updated_at": "2019-09-19T18:43:52.715934Z",
                "login": "Alice",
                "info": "Live from Wonderland",
                "admin": false
            },
            "message": "Please be my friend.",
        }
    ]
}
$ curl -H $AS_ALICE http://$URL/users/$ALICE_ID  |python3 -m json.tool
{
    "id": "2acc6f8a-42ec-4f4b-bfe8-149ed0a83372",
    "created_at": "2019-09-19T18:43:52.715929Z",
    "updated_at": "2019-09-19T18:43:52.715934Z",
    "login": "Alice",
    "info": "Live from Wonderland",
    "admin": false,
    "incoming_requests": [
        {
            "id": "0f121386-f0cf-4f55-bb33-66a072d18801",
            "created_at": "2019-09-19T21:47:33.15393Z",
            "updated_at": "2019-09-19T21:47:33.153936Z",
            "from": {
                "id": "d9e24321-cd55-4349-85f8-047bec35175c",
                "created_at": "2019-09-19T18:44:13.407875Z",
                "updated_at": "2019-09-19T20:32:36.739483Z",
                "login": "Bob",
                "info": "Not a sponge",
                "admin": false
            },
            "message": "Please be my friend.",
        }
    ]
}
```

Please note that this information is **private**, i.e. it is kept
invisible to everybody (including Bob) except Alice (and admins) on Alice's profile:

```bash
$ curl -H $AS_BOB http://$URL/users/$ALICE_ID |python3 -m json.tool
{
    "id": "2acc6f8a-42ec-4f4b-bfe8-149ed0a83372",
    "created_at": "2019-09-19T18:43:52.715929Z",
    "updated_at": "2019-09-19T18:43:52.715934Z",
    "login": "Alice",
    "info": "Live from Wonderland",
    "admin": false
}
```

Also, not shown here:

* Alice can't make a friend-request to Bob while there's
already one the other way round: this avoids breaking the consistency in
the database. A Tinder-like matchmaking system would be overkill here.
* Bob can't request himself as a friend,
* Bob can't make friend requests to his friends,
* Bob can have only one pending friend request to Alice:
he can make a second one only if she declines the first one.

Alice (and only her, not even admins) can either:

* Accept (`GET /friend_requests/{request_id}/accept`)
* Decline (`GET /friend_requests/{request_id}/decline`)

Let's accept it, and see that Bob and Alice are now friends:

```bash
$ curl -H $AS_ALICE http://$URL/friend_requests/0f121386-f0cf-4f55-bb33-66a072d18801/accept
$ curl -H $AS_ALICE http://$URL/users/$ALICE_ID | python3 -m json.tool
{
    "id": "2acc6f8a-42ec-4f4b-bfe8-149ed0a83372",
    "created_at": "2019-09-19T18:43:52.715929Z",
    "updated_at": "2019-09-19T18:43:52.715934Z",
    "login": "Alice",
    "info": "Live from Wonderland",
    "admin": false,
    "friends": [
        {
            "id": "d9e24321-cd55-4349-85f8-047bec35175c",
            "created_at": "2019-09-19T18:44:13.407875Z",
            "updated_at": "2019-09-19T20:32:36.739483Z",
            "login": "Bob",
            "info": "Not a sponge",
            "admin": false
        }
    ]
}
```

Once a friend request is accepted (resp. declined) it can't be "declined (resp. accepted) back".

**Note:** This bidirectional, many-to-many relationship, is modelled as two distinct
lines within the same table (one for Bob to Alice, and one for Alice to Bob).
This design choice is debatable (friendships take more space in the database),
however it results in simpler code. [More info
here](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10807900/how-to-store-bidirectional-relationships-in-a-rdbms-like-mysql).

Friendships are also private:

* Bob can't see Alice's friends, even if he's part of them.
* Admins can see Alice and Bob's friends.

Finally, Alice can unfriend Bob with `GET /users/{user_id}/unfriend`:
